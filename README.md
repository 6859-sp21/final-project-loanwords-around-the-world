# Where did that word come from?

This work is the joint effort of Jason Madeano and Andrei Dumitrescu. With our visualization we aim to excite a broad general audience about language. There are over 7000 languages spoken around the world but most people only know or experience a handful of them. Especially now that many languages are going extinct at an alarming rate, this visualization was built to help people see the common strings connecting the world's languages.

The [website](https://6859-sp21.github.io/final-project-loanwords-around-the-world/index.html) was designed to be able to stand alone and provides instructions for the users to help them understand the wealth of interaction opportunities. The full paper describing the design decisions and process is included in this repository (`FinalPaper.pdf`).

## Division of work
__Work Done by Andrei:__ Andrei was responsible implementing the slider bar and writing a large portion of the writeup with consultation from Jason. This took Andrei an estimated 18-20 hours total to do over the past few weeks

__Work Done by Jason:__ Jason picked the dataset, performed an exploratory analysis in python, and cleaned the data to get into a workable format for D3. He implemented the barcharts and the map with consultation from Andrei, wrote the introduction text for the website, and took care of the layout of the website. This took Jason an estimated 50-60 hours total to do over the past few weeks.
